In February TABLEFLIP ran a [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) event as part of the [SINFO conference](http://www.sinfo.org/). The event went really well and we got great feedback on the day. However, it wasn't until recently that we were given the official feedback that was gathered from a questionnaire attendees were given after the event.

We thought we'd take the chance to share some of that feedback:

> "These guys are awesome!"

> "Awesome, invite the speakers again next year!"

> "The best workshop from this edition of SINFO!"

> "Awesome! Loved it, was the first experience.‚Äù

In the pie charts below, the scale is from 1 to 5 where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
