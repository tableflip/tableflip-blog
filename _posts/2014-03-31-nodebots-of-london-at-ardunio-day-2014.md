Tableflip, along with [Nodebots of London](http://www.meetup.com/NodeBots-of-London/) co-organiser [Alex Potsides](https://twitter.com/achingbrain) stormed the London College of Communication in celebration of international Arduino Day 2014 ([#ArduinoD14](https://twitter.com/search?q=ArduinoD14)).

We ran a beginners workshop designed to teach people the fundementals of using [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and the [johnny-five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) library to talk to Arduinos.

Many of the attendees were entirely new to coding, let alone coding using JavaScript, which proved both challenging and rewarding.

In truth, a lot of the work had been done for us already. We made heavy use of the excellent [Arduino Experimenter's Guide for NodeJS website](http://node-ardx.org/) which walks you through using various components such as LEDs, motors and servos, giving you circuit diagrams and code samples to draw from. We can't thank [Anna Gerber](https://github.com/AnnaGerber) enough for the fantastic work she's put into it.

Our attendees were polite, open minded and excitable which really helps when picking up something completely new. Thanks to all who came.

Aside from our workshop, the day involved a whole host of other projects, demos, hacks, talks and workshops from [London Arduino](http://www.meetup.com/LondonArduino/), [Not Just Arduino](http://notjustarduino.org) and [South London Makerspace](http://southlondonmakerspace.org/). Check out [the hackpad](https://hackpad.com/Arduino-Day-LCC-0ykEyUcLj3o) with all the info about the day, including links to pictures, code etc. Thanks especially to [Marc Barto](https://twitter.com/marc_in_london) for organising and [Tom Lynch](https://twitter.com/unknowndomain) for sorting the venue.
