A stratovolcano<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratovolcano)</sup> waiting to blurt out a fountain of opinions, observations, frustrations and wisdoms. Driven by our experiences working with many clients on varying projects and disparate code bases. From greenfield to legacy and everything in between our affliction to using the newest most shiny tech gives us a unique outlook on the state of the world of development in Node.js and JavaScript. We can no longer stem the fire hose. The TABLEFLIP podcast is here.
