Meteor London buffets on the winds of chance and optimism. As a monthly, demo-centric, early-adopter support group, we encourage people to have a go; it's a show & tell for fancy hacks to production apps, and everything in between:

>"Build a Meteor demo, as simple or fancy as you like. Then, _the clever bit_, we meet up and compare notes. The fancy can show off their wares and the curious can learn a trick or two."

So on the [10th of April](http://www.meetup.com/Meteor-London/events/173719312/), in the salubrius uSwitch auditorium, the floor was once again opened up to the community to talk about all things Meteor, and we were treated to:

**Making iOS developement a tiny bit less horrible with Reactive Cocoa:** A tech talk from our favourite full-stack designer, [Jon Gold](https://twitter.com/jongold), who has been tinking with native apps that sync up with Meteor apps, and showed us how to talk DDP from an iPhone app, and how to re-create the reactive coding style over in native-land via [Reactive Cocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa)

![Applause for the Jon Gold](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/e/d/4/600_355548852.jpeg)

That segued nicely into the all important burrito break! Big thanks to [poncho8](http://poncho8.com/) and MDG for most excellent edibles and to tech community wizard [James Chesters](https://twitter.com/jameschesters) for the tip off!

After the tortilla frenzy we launched straight into 8 lightning talks:

- **Building Meteor apps for fun and food**: A quick intro to the anatomy of a Meteor app with some simple demos from that [olizilla](https://twitter.com/olizilla): [Lunch leaderboard](https://github.com/olizilla/makelunch), for figuring out whose turn it is to make lunch at the [tableflip](http://tableflip.io/) office, and [monster me](http://monster.meteor.com/), a [code club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) project to transmogriphy a young coder into a giggling monster.

- **[Card Flash](http://cardflashapp.com/)** by **Peter Jones**:
_"Learn large amounts of small information."_ ...never forget a thing again, using Meteor, flash cards and some brain science to upgrade your mind cogs.

- **[Oplog tailing and you](https://gist.github.com/alanshaw/10046987)** by **[Alan Shaw](https://twitter.com/_alanshaw)**:
There's been a lot of talk about the new mongo oplog tailing feature, so Mr Shaw gave a run down of the old poll'n'diff mechanism, the new oplog tailing style and the improvements it brings.

- **[Clusterlists](http://clusterlists.com/)** by **Jordan Burgess**
A really shiny, drag and drop app for taking the clunky world of managing twitter lists and giving it a real-time, Meteor make over.

- **[Futurescaper](http://www.futurescaper.com/) & [Podaris](http://podaris.meteor.com/)** by **Nathan Koren**:
Using Meteor to help synchornise mind-maps & massive engineering projects, The super smart Mr Koren showed us the "D3-based force-directed network visualisations" that power [Futurescaper](http://www.futurescaper.com/), a crowdsourced scenario planning tool.

- **[Sheffield University Hubs hub](http://winwardo.co.uk/mini/eyh/)** by **Topher Winward**, in 3 hours whipped up a real time replacement for the pile of clunky spreadsheets he was handed, including chat rooms and google app authentication for @sheffield.ac.uk users.

- **[tilr.io](https://www.tilr.io/)** by **Nelson Correia**: A fully featured micro blogging platform, already in production, helping school children document and share as they learn.

- **Abletone** by **[Chris Waring](https://twitter.com/cwaring) & the iphone improv ensemble**:
For the grand finale Chris assembled a live band of iphone wielding musicians with a clever integration of Meteor and Ableton Live, creating a musical extravaganza from randomly selected players, which, despite minimal declared musical ability, sounded great; somehow even the rick-roll was right on beat.
