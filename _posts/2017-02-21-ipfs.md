During the 5th TABLEFLIP podcast the team take some time out to wonder at the Inter Planetary File System.

Don't be left with a bad-buntu instead use a trusty [Merkle DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System#Merkle_data_format) to insure you are getting the best platform for sharing your cat gifs.
