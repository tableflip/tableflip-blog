        <h1>Test the ideas</h1>
        <p><strong><em>Ideas are king, but not all of them are royalty material.</em></strong></p>
        <p>Still, it's important to find out. You really don't know what kind of idea you've got until it's been tested. TABLEFLIP encourages a creative working relationship where all the things are tried out to see what works best.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>Stuff that doesn't work gets pruned and you're left with an awesome simple thing that does something new and interesting.</p>
        <p>What if you could ship a thing after a week? How about every week? Well, this is what tableflip does...and then you can change direction of the project, reprioritise, or continue with the plan.</p>

        <h2>NodeBots</h2>
        <p>TABLEFLIP have co-organised the nodebots meetup since mid 2013.</p>
        <div class="full">
          <p>TABLEFLIP jointly built the <code>nodebot-workshop</code> a commmand line based workshop designed to get people up and running with the de facto Node.js library for communicating with hardware: `johnny-five` through a series of code challenges that make use of hardware components commonly used by hardware enthusiasts. TABLEFLIP also built the new [nodebots website](http://nodebots.io/).</p>

          <p>TABLEFLIP were invited to [NodeConf](http://nodeconf.com/) 2014 in San Francisco to run the hardware workshop.</p>

          <p>For NodeBots day 2014, TABLEFLIP collaborated with Alex Potsides to produce an extra special meetup where attendees could buy and build their own bluetooth powered, laser cut robot vehicles.</p>

        <h2>DRIIFT</h2>
        <p>Automated entry, realtime analytics and attendee insights all using the latest NFC + Beacon technologies.</p>
        <div class="full">
          <p>In collaboration with Chris Waring of wwaves, TABLEFLIP took their Meteor knowledge and built a web and NFC based solution for conferences and festivals to gain insight and info on their event, in realtime.</p>
          <p>[DRIIFT](http://signup.driift.io/) provides all sorts of awesomes that allow attendees to have more fun and make more connections, sponsors to gather more leads and get their name out better, and organisers to get info on how their event went, where people were and what they were doing.</p>
          <p>DRIIFT is built as a Meteor web application and a Cordova phone app. It uses the latest NFC technology at it's base. We've been seen at tech events such as [bacon conf](http://devslovebacon.com/), [LXJS](http://2014.lxjs.org/) and [Container Camp](http://container.camp/).</p>

          <p>We built the [London chapter site](http://nodeschool.io/london/) and can be regularly seen helping others on the [NodeSchool discussion forums](https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/).
          <p>Our workshop "Nodebot Workshop" is a featured elective on the [NodeSchool website](http://nodeschool.io/).</p>

        <h2>Polestar</h2>
        <p>TABLEFLIP worked extensively with Polestar on their flagship application Purplefinder.</p>
        <div class="full">
          <p>[Polestar Space Applications](http://www.polestarglobal.com/) primarily allow their customers to track and monitor their fleet through various web and mobile applications. TABLEFLIP worked extensively with Polestar on their flagship application Purplefinder.</p>

          <p>TABLEFLIP was tasked with re-skining their aging Java applet based web application to give it a new lease of life. We worked closely with the backend team to integrate a new look and feel and port the features of the applet to a new, modern, [LeafletJS](http://leafletjs.com/) based map. We made use of the latest web technologies such as websockets and CSS3 animations whilst also ensuring the application was useable on mobile devices.</p>

          <p>TABLEFLIP also built their main website and their newest product to hit the financial market [PurpleTRAC](http://purpletrac.polestarglobal.com/trade-and-commodity-finance/what-is-purpletrac).</p>

        <p>TABLEFLIP and friends organise the monthly Meteor London meetup.</p>
        <div class="full">
          <p>Meteor have contracted TABLEFLIP on a number of occasions to build various internal as well as external projects. Our most recent collaboration was on the "Meteor Now" campaign website, which aimed to raise $25,000 for [CodeNow](http://codenow.org/) - a nonprofit focused on teaching under-represented youth to code.</p>

          <p>TABLEFLIP recently started running [Meteor training](http://www.meteorlondon.com/) for javascript developers and beginners, aiming to introduce building web apps with Meteor.</p>

          <p>The first training day was a great success, we had around 10 students and also teamed up with [Ladies who Code](http://www.ladieswhocode.com/) to offer a scholorship place.</p>

          <p>In October 2014 Meteor released the long awaited version 1.0 of the framework and with it redesigned their logo and website.
